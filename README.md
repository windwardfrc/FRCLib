FRC Wrapper

What's up people (Probaby only Richter, Brody, or Lucas).

Integration, Right?

Okay.

1. Download as zip, then unzip.

2. Open FRCLib.java

3. Go to your Robotics Project

4. Make a new class, name it FRCLib

5. Then copy and paste the source of FRCLib.java into the newly created class.

6. The parser will complain about some package stuff or something so correct it.

7. Test integration by initializing FRCLib

*FRCLib.init(); //if it throws an error you did something wrong*
